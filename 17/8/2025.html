    <h1>What ?</h1>
    <p>
      I realized that nobody is permanent in my life except myself. Life goes on without others. 
      Today my father also told me: 
      <span class="highlight">"দুনিয়ার কেউ কারো না। এটা সব সময় বুঝে চলবি।"</span>
      Maybe the thoughts I am having today, the dreams I am chasing today—everything might be wrong. 
      One day everyone will leave me, even my parents. Then what? Who am I? What am I really thinking? 
      Have I ever thought deeply about it?<br><br>

      Why do I become so angry and rude over silly reasons? I am a human being, but maybe I have some 
      mental issues. Why do I always want to be successful? Is being successful really that easy? 
      I think I should be stronger in accepting my defeats. I shouldn’t get so angry if anyone says 
      something wrong about me. They have their own tongue, so they can speak anything they want.<br><br>

      The way I take their words so seriously might be my own mental instability. So I should fix this. 
      Otherwise, since nobody is permanent in my life, I should focus on myself. I know at this moment 
      it’s very hard for me. It may take about 2 to 3 months. It will make me suffer a lot and bring 
      indescribable mental pain. But still, I should accept it.
